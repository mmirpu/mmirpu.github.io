Assignment 1 : Your Portfolio 
February 8th, 2017

This project uses HTML5 and CSS to create a personal portfolio for myself. It took me approximately 6-7 hours for this project. I discussed the project with some of my friends - Nikita Rao, Jordan Bacher and Bianca Capretta. I have created the following files and was able to create a functioning website. I correctly implemented my html and css files. However, I don't think I did it in the most efficient way because I could have had one CSS file that would style all my webpages instead of having 3. 

List of files

Index.html

This includes the information and picture on my personal home page. This page then contains links to both my Bio page and Resume page. 

I also have an index.html file in my CS account in the public_html that redirects to my actual Github website. 

Index.css

CSS are cascading style sheets that describe how HTML elements are displayed on the screen. This file styles the index.html file. 

Bio.html

This includes a short biography about myself.

Bio.css

This file styles the bio.html file. 


Resume.html

This includes the content of my webpage.

Resume.css

This file styles the resume.html file.
